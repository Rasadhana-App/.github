# Rasadhana: Waste Less, Savor More

This app was developed by Team C242-PS398 Bangkit Capstone Project 2024

## Description

The food and beverage (F&B) industry in Indonesia faces significant challenges related to food waste management, particularly among small businesses such as restaurants and food stalls. These establishments often have leftover ingredients that are not utilized effectively, leading to economic losses and environmental impact. There is a need for practical solutions that enable these businesses to identify and manage leftover food ingredients more efficiently. Developing a system that provides recipe recommendations based on available ingredients could help address this issue and promote sustainability in the industry.
